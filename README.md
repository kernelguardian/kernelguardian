Thanks for stopping by and taking a moment to explore my journey and expertise.

## About Me

I'm currently on an exciting adventure as a full-time Master's student, pursuing Advanced Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the esteemed University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. With around 2 years of hands-on experience as a Product Engineer, I've been crafting tools that are an integral part of dynamic ecosystems.

## Things I am working on
1. instruct2action - A new paradigm for automation using AI
2. CRDT based collaborative song database

## Embracing Versatility 🌐

I'm all about embracing versatility in the tech world. I thrive on diving into various technologies and approaches without tying myself down to a single language or tool. My role as a generalist allows me to traverse different domains, and it's this dynamic approach that keeps my creative juices flowing.

## Where AI Meets CI/CD 🤖⚙️

My foundation in Artificial Intelligence is rock-solid, and I have a deep affection for building Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I've had the pleasure of working with and deploying substantial language models like Bloom and Flan, adding an AI-powered touch to my toolkit.

## Containerization Aficionado 📦🚀

Containerization technology is my playground! I have a knack for orchestrating containers and have even engineered a tool to dance with them harmoniously. Whether it's Docker, Kubernetes, or other containerization solutions, I've got it covered.

## Solving the Unsolvable 💡🔍

My journey as a Product Engineer led me to tackle the enigma of the Language Server Protocol. Navigating through intricate technical documentation, I managed to distill this knowledge into a practical project. I even assembled a step-by-step guide for building this from scratch, bridging the gap between the complexity and accessibility of niche technologies.

## A Fusion of Skills 🔗🚀

Individually, my skills might appear modest, but together, they form a niche subset of expertise that's truly distinctive. My prowess spans CI/CD orchestration, containerization, software development, and AI. I'm not content with the boundaries of my current role; I'm always yearning to learn and evolve beyond those confines.
